# Star Trek API Dashboard
Using [stapi.co](https://stapi.co/) we are building out a fun and function dashboard to search for a variety of information that exists in the ***Star Trek*** franchise. This also allows us to each develope a unique view, while maintaining a style. It's a pretty flexible API, and that's ultimately what we're looking for.
