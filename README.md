# Star Trek API Dashboard
Using [stapi.co](https://stapi.co/) we are building out a fun and function dashboard to search for a variety of information that exists in the ***Star Trek*** franchise. This also allows us to each develope a unique view, while maintaining a style. It's a pretty flexible API, and that's ultimately what we're looking for.

# Cost
This is a free API with no keys! It is perfect for making simple axios/fetch requests to with structured `GET` requests that will return data we then format and display to the user.

# Other API examined
In preparation for this project we looked at several.
- [igdb.com](https://igdb.com) - To create a games lookup search type engine to see what games are coming out this year, or have come out. There would have been additional features that each of us would have worked on, such as exploring historical releases, or releases of a specific genre. We elected to not use this one simply because of clunky or incomplete the data can be that comes back from a request.
- [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/) - There are so many to choose from. This would have worked great for each of us to essentially pick one and work, but we also found that if each of us are working on a separate API, then what would be the point of the group project? It would have still worked but each of us would have been so disconnected from the others we wouldn't really be much of a team. If issues came up we would have run the risk of being unable to help someone or just taking import hours of work from another side of the project to debug someone elses. All excellent APIs though!
- [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) - This has been done a lot already. Also, the documentation isn't great and they have started charging for, it sort of. They have this "one call" API, but also a bunch of other endpoints to hit too. Mostly just the confusing nature of their approach these days was a major deterrent.
