# Star Trek API Dashboard
Using [stapi.co](https://stapi.co/) we are building out a fun and function dashboard to search for a variety of information that exists in the ***Star Trek*** franchise. This also allows us to each develope a unique view, while maintaining a style. It's a pretty flexible API, and that's ultimately what we're looking for.

# Cost
This is a free API with no keys! It is perfect for making simple axios/fetch requests to with structured `GET` requests that will return data we then format and display to the user.

# How to run
- Clone the repository to whatever directory you desire
- Type `npm install` while in that directory
- To start the local environment to see the changes type `npm run dev`
- Install the following extensions as well in VSCode:
  - A debugger for Firefox or Chrome for webdev
  - CSS Navigation
  - Code Spell Checker
  - ESLint
  - ES7 + React/Redux/React-Native snippets
  - HTML CSS Support
  - Import Cost
  - Intellisense for CSS class names in HTML
  - JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets (even though we use TS)
  - npm Intellisense
  - Prettier
  - Simple React Snippets
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (ABSOLUTE MUST!!! VERY GOOD!!!)
  - VSCode React Refactor

If you wind up having issues after the fact, lets talk. - Alex
